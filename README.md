# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmcarter38/">Maurice Carter</a>'s IT Project Portfolio 🔐

I completed these projects through a hands-on cyber range, working collaboratively in a live, SOC environment to simulate real-world cybersecurity operations. What I love most about IT is the need to continuously learn and grow. 😁
